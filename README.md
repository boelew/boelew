Hello visitor ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m @boelew 

I'm working for a company named Sioux Technologies. In my professional career I've most experience with .NET languages. But languages like C, C++ and Rust are also not a big deal. 
Besides that I've many years experience with web technologies like PHP, javascript and CSS. Building websites from scratch is something I like to do.
Professionaly I've been working in various fields. It's always technical and some examples are companies in the chemical field, building automation, parcel delivery (sortation machines), lithography and image recognition.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Math and the Rust programming language.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: send an email to wilco.boele@sioux.eu if you want to contact me.
