Hello visitor ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m @boelew 

I'm working for a company named Sioux Technologies, since 2012. In my professional career I've most experience with C#, C++. Languages like C and Rust I'm also familiar with.
Besides that I've many years experience with web technologies like PHP, javascript and CSS. Building websites from scratch is something I like to do.
Professionaly I've been working in various fields. It's always technical and some examples are companies in the chemical field, building automation, parcel delivery (sortation machines), lithography and image recognition.
